# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The project compares the launch dates and funding goals of plays to understand their success rate. This will allow us to understand whether Louise will be successful in her funding goal for Fever. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to see if Louise's play Fever would be successfully reach its goal based on the analysis of other plays and their launch dates and funding goals. I have visually represented the data so that Louise can easily understand whether or not she will be successful.

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the launch date, Louise would be most successful if their launch date was around Mar to May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on funding goals Louise could have a success rate of around 80% if their goal was less than $5,000 or $35,000 to $45,000. They are also more likley to fail if the funding amount is around $25,000 to $35,000 and greater than $45,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I encountered challenges while trying to use the countifs formula. Once I was able to understand the formula better then I was able to successfully collect the data. To ensure that I was using the formula correct I would filter the data and sum the coloums in order to ensure I had the same numbers. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the "Theatre Outcomes vs Launch Dates" graph, we can conclude that a launch date around May would be the most successful. We can also conclude that a launch date around December would be the least successful.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on the "Outcomes vs Goals" graph, we can conclude that funding goals of a range of $25,000 to $35,000 and larger than $45,000 are more likely to fail. Goals of $10,000 and a rang of$35,000 to $45,000 have greater than a 50% chance of being successful. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
In order to provide Louise with the most successful outcomes it would be beneficial to analyze the timeframe from the launch date to deadline since Louise said that they have a short time period. 

It would also be beneficial to understand which country this play is showing in, in order to provide an accurate analysis and conclusion.
